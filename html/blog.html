			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 10 </h2>
			<p> With the tire done for now, I started working on unwrapping the car. This is how it has come out so far. It is taking
				much longer than the tire and I expect this to take me a couple days if I work on it for a few hours every day.
				I also just placed the tires under the car for display purposes for now. I am planning to combine them with the car 
				later. I think I need to extrude a face on the inside of the tire as well because you can see through the spokes, and I
				don't think it is supposed to look like that. Since I didn't model the inside and underneath of the car, nothing is there
				to fill in the empty space.</p>

			<p> With the tire unwrapped, I wanted to add a basic texture. I created one in Photoshop and made a specular map to make
				the metal shine, and I'm actually really happy with how it came out. My model isn't super realistic, and the texture
				isn't either, so I think they look well together. I could work with it and see if I can make something I like more, but
				for now I am going to keep it the way it is and work on the body of the car again.</p>

			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 8 </h2>
			<p> I needed a break from the body of the car and was excited to see how the car would look with actual tires, so I started
				working on the tire. I created the object out of a hollow cylinder and created edge loops and extruded inward to create the tire treads
				and extruded to the center to get the spokes of the tire. I unwrapped it in large pieces to try to minimize the 
				seams, and the seems are mainly on the rubber part of the tire, so it will be hard to see anyway. </p>

			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 7 </h2>
			<p> I did the detail for the back of the car today. I carved out the tail lights and a spot for the license plate. 
				I extruded the exhaust pipes and created some indents to try to define the trunk of the car. I realized I haven't 
				added handles to the doors of the car yet, so I should probably do that soon, but I'm not sure how. I might have to 
				make them as separate objects like I did with the spoiler. Extruding might make the mesh too messy.</p>

			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 6 </h2>
			<p> I did a little more work to the hood of the car and added the back window of the car. I redid the spoiler as well, since I 
			really was not happy with the first one I did. I decided that it would be best to make the spoiler a separate object. I tried several 
			times to extrude a spoiler but I ended up with too many n-gons and a shape that I was not going for. I was happy with how the separate 
			object came out so I chose to keep it. </p>

			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 5 </h2>
			<p> I finally took on the challenge of detailing the front of the car. It took more edge loops than I would have liked, but
			it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I made horizontal and vertical edge loops, and extruded every other face inward.
			The car in the preview here is seen with a smooth preview to see how the car would actually look if I smoothed it. I also made the
			mustang logo which also easier than I thought it would be. I used the same technique as the car. I started the a basic rectangle and
			added edge loops and moved them until I got the shape that I wanted. I deleted faces in order to get the gaps between the legs
			of the mustang. I changed the lambert color on the car to white so I could see the mustang more easily.

			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 4 </h2>
			<p> I've added a lot of detail since the last update. I carved out spots for the detail for the front of the car and
				the headlights. I added the windows and the side view mirrors. I still have not changed the spoiler, but I am still planning to.
				Every part of the car so far has been extruded out of the same object. The side view mirrors, for example, are not separate objects. 
				I'm beginning to think there was a better way of doing this. Having separate pieces might have been a better idea and might have 
				helped cut down on the poly count.

			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 3 </h2>
			<p> I started to define the shape of the hood, headlights, wind shield and the spoiler. I rounded out the rest of the car as well
			The back, sides, and bottom of the front are rounded now, and I carved out and rounded the spots for the tires. I'm not really
			happy with the spoiler, so I think I will end up changing that. I'm also not sure about how to go about detailing the front of the car,
			but it will be fun to try. </p>

			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 2 </h2>
			<p> I continued working on getting the basic shape of the car. To start I mainly focused on rounding out the hood of the car.
				I create a basic shape for the rest of the top of the car and left the bottom in a box shape for now. I didn't want to take on
				too much of the car at a time. I think working on one part at a time will be best in the end.</p>

			<h2 class ="title"> Mustang - Update 1 </h2>
			<p> Today I decided to start a side project for myself to test my skills that I learned this past semester in Maya. 
				I wanted to either build a house or a car, and I decided a car was a good place to start. One of my favorite
				cars is the Mustang so I chose to model one. I imported some reference images that I found, unfortunately not of 
				the same car, but of the same or very similar model. My goal isn't to create an exact replica, but to try to make
				something something that I couldn't have made a few months ago, so different but similar models in the references
				isn't a big deal to me. I started off with just a block and started adding edge loops to try to get closer to a car shape. </p>
